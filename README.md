### 📖 Game Request Examples

**Good Request:**
> "Please create a game based on 'Quantum Error Correction with Superconducting Qubits' by Chen et al. The paper demonstrates a 7-qubit surface code. I'd love to see an interactive game where students can build error correction circuits and see how quantum errors are detected and corrected in real-time."

**Even Better Request:**
> "I'm teaching a graduate course on quantum computing and would love a game based on [specific paper link]. The key concepts are surface codes, logical qubits, and syndrome detection. Students should learn how to: 1) Identify error patterns, 2) Apply correction operations, 3) Understand the threshold theorem. Could the game include a circuit builder and error injection simulator?"
